# SHORT DESCRIPTION:

## 1.CLIENTSIDE:Client side refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser.

## 2.SERVERSIDE:Server side means everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client. This includes rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.

## 3.HTTP PROTOCOLS:The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web. As a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.

## 4.HTTP VS HTTPS:HTTP URL in your browser's address bar is http:// and the HTTPS URL is https://. HTTP is unsecured while HTTPS is secured. HTTP sends data over port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443. HTTP operates at application layer, while HTTPS operates at transport layer. No SSL certificates are required for HTTP, with HTTPS it is required that you have an SSL certificate and it is signed by a CA. HTTP doesn't require domain validation, where as HTTPS requires at least domain validation and certain certificates even require legal document validation. No encryption in HTTP, with HTTPS the data is encrypted before sending.

## 5.FRAMEWORKS VS LIBRARIES:The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.
